# CoinSimulator
This was a small little project I did to solve a math problem once involving probability. Wanted to upload it so I have it for the future

It simulates all possible flip combinations of a fair coin 8 times in a row and counts how many times 3 or more of the same type of flip appear.

If you find a use for this feel free to use it however
